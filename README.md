## ‚ú® Additional Feature: Animations with NativeWind

This section details the extra feature implemented as part of the final course challenge.

### Description
The Quiz App now includes smooth and visually appealing animations using the `NativeWind` library. Animations are applied to question transitions, answer feedback, and the results screen, enhancing the user experience. For example, questions and answers animate in and out, and feedback for correct or incorrect answers is highlighted with animated effects powered by utility classes.

### Challenges and Learnings
To implement these animations, I learned how to use `NativeWind` for styling and animation in React Native. The main challenge was coordinating animation timing with state changes, ensuring that feedback animations played before moving to the next question. Through this, I gained experience with utility-first styling and integrating animation utilities for a more dynamic interface.
